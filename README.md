## Search through list functionality

I developed this mini search app only for learning purposes. However, if you want to use it in some of your apps, feel free to do that.

## Setup

First of all you need to download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You will need it for the server part.
You don't need a database, the list I am using for the search is a hard coded array, so, just open cmd in the root application folder and `npm install`.

## Run the server
To run the server you will need to execute `npm server.js` in the application route folder. Or even better, install `nodemon` so
you can start the server with `nodemon server.js`. Using nodemon you will have no need of server reset after every change of your server.js file.
Application is available on localhost:3000.

## You are done

After this setup you should be available to fully use this mini application. Please comment or contact for any further questions or possible problems.
PS: The short list needed for the app contains a small number of some useful programing sites and blogs. :)
